## Plain-text Editing

### Markdown

What a markdown file I'm editing looks like in my neovim config

I use markdown-preview.nvim to see what I am writing and actually read my notes

### $\LaTeX$
I use vimtex for my $\LaTeX$ editing \
Screenshots comming soon...

## Git Integration

I use the amazing fugit2.nvim plugin along with gitsigns.nvim for my git integration

## LSP and Completion Integration

I use nvim-lspconfig and mason.nvim for my LSP integration. I use conform.nvim for formatting and null-ls for other linters. With LSP, I also use trouble.nvim to visualize errors and hints better. I use nvim-cmp for completions.

#### Null-LS and Trouble.nvim at work

#### My nvim-cmp config

## File Navigation

I use nvim-tree, telescope, and harpoon for file navigation. In the future, I might switch from nvim-tree to oil.nvim and from telescope to fzf-lua.

#### Telescope
